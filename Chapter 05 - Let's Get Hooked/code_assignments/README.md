                                        Coding Assignment:
                                        Clean up your code.
                                        Create a Folder Structure for your app.
                                        Make different files for each Component.
                                        Create a config file.
                                        Use all types of import and export.
                                        Create a Search Box in your App.
                                        Use useState to create a variable and bind it to the input box.
                                        Try to make your search bar work.



                                               Two types of Export/Import

                                                            Default Export/Import
                                                            export default Component; import Component from "path";

                                                            Named Export/Import
                                                            export const Component; import {Component} from "path";

                                                            - useEffect()
